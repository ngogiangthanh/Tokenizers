"Broken threads :"
"An autobiography, With pref. by Lord Milne of Salonika and Rubislaw, and foreword by Lord Hankey"
"You would think that, after a hundred years or so, it would all get easier -- life, love, finding your place in the universe, that sort of thing. You would be wrong. Chalk it up to existing in these modern times! with the baggage of being a vampire. Banish from your mind the gothic castle-living, suave and debonair, classically handsome, shape-shifting creature of the night you've grown accustomed to. In its place, insert Barry, an overweight, balding, likeable guy who orders blood over the internet and lives in a middle-class apartment complex. For Barry, that life gets more complicated when, through the influence of a schizophrenic psychic and a seven-foot angel on a mission from God, he finds out that a forgotten part of his past is a pissed-off freelance vampire hit man with a real itch for miniature golf and undiagnosed mental issues. Needless to say, high jinks and peril ensue"
