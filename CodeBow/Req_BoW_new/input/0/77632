"Introduction to systems analysis and design"

"A complete, but less complex approach to SAAndD. Introduction to Systems Analysis And Design is organized like Whitten's best-selling Systems Analysis And Design Methods, but without the information systems architecture framework theme that overwhelms some students. Each chapter covers the same topics, but stops short of advanced details that are unnecessary to the typical first course."
