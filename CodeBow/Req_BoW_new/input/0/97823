"Satisficing games and decision making :"
"With applications to engineering and computer science"
"In our day to day lives we constantly make decisions which are simply 'good enough' rather than optimal--a type of decision for which Professor Wynn Stirling has adopted the word 'satisficing'. Most computer decision making algorithms, however, seek only the optimal solution based on rigid criteria and reject others. This book outlines an alternative approach, using novel algorithms and techniques to more closely model the way humans make decisions. It will therefore be of great interest to engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians working on artificial intelligence and expert systems."
