"Dynamic modeling"

"An understanding of the changing relationships within systems is an integral part of the study of a variety of disciplines. The second edition of Dynamic Modeling gives a thorough introduction to modeling by teaching the reader both to build and to use a wide range of models, including those for biological, physical, social and economic systems. In conjunction with STELLA software provided with the book, the reader has an easy-to-use tool to visualize all types of dynamic systems."
