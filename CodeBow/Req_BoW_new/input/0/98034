"Discrete choice methods with simulation"

"This book describes the new generation of discrete choice methods. Researchers use these statistical methods to examine the choices that consumers, households, firms, and other agents make. Each of the major models is covered: logit, generalized extreme value, or GEV (including nested and cross-nested logits), probit, and mixed logit, plus a variety of specifications that build on these basics. The procedures are applicable in many fields, including energy, transportation, environmental studies, health, labor, and marketing."
