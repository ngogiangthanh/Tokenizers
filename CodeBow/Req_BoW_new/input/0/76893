"Algorithms, architectures and applications"
"Coding Theory: Algorithms, Architectures and Applications provides a concise overview of channel coding theory and practice, as well as the accompanying signal processing architectures. The book is unique in presenting algorithms, architectures, and applications of coding theory in a unified framework. It covers the basics of coding theory before moving on to discuss algebraic linear block and cyclic codes, turbo codes and low density parity check codes and space-time codes. Coding Theory provides algorithms and architectures used for implementing coding and decoding strategies as well as coding schemes used in practice especially in communication systems."
