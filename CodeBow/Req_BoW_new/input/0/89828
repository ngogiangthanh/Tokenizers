"Systems for all"

"This volume offers a new systems paradigm, presents a systems outlook, defines key concepts and outlines the principles of characterizing complex systems in a qualitative way and by the systematic use of models and measures. The book presents the product/process (P/p) methodology: a coherent collection of generic but readily understandable concepts, rigorous but applicable methods and principles of reasoning. This methodology assists in understanding any system and helps in the formulation and effective solution of complex problems, regardless of the field in which they arise and irrespective of the specialist disciplines needed for supplying the solution."
