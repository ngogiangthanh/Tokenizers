"Nonlinear systems"

"This book is written is such a way that the level of mathematical sophistication builds up from chapter to chapter. It has been reorganized into four parts: basic analysis, analysis of feedback systems, advanced analysis, and nonlinear feedback control. Updated content includes subjects which have proven useful in nonlinear control design in recent yearsâ€”new in the 3rd edition are: expanded treatment of passivity and passivity-based control
 integral control, high-gain feedback, recursive methods, optimal stabilizing control, control Lyapunov functions, and observers. For use as a self-study or reference guide by engineers and applied mathematicians."
